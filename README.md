# ðŸŽ¨ LiveDraw for Figma

Draw in low-fidelity in realtime in Figma. As seen in [this video](https://x.com/jsngr/status/1738245938500558906?s=20).

Make sure to replace `fal_key_id` and `fal_key_secret` with your API keys from [fal.ai](https://www.fal.ai/).

Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`. Then import the `manifest.json` of the plugin into Figma.
